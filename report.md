### Problem Statement

1. Read CSV file. Then, Crop, Cleanse and Refactor the Data.
2. Create and implement a relational database.
3. Write python scripts to populate the database & generate SQL.
4. Design, write and run SQL queries.
5. Model, implement and query a selected NoSQL database.

#### My method of operation
1. Read and understand the problems.
2. Create a plan and start looking for solutions.
3. Building up the logic for approaching the solution.
4. Implementation in order to achieve the desired results

#### Learning outcomes
1. Learning python library pandas.
2. Read csv file, Crop, Cleanse and Refactor the Data.
2. Design ER digram by using MySQL workbench
3. Implementing and populating Mysql database.  
3. MySQL query practice with python. 
4. Model data for NOSQL database by using MongoDB.
5. Populate NoSQL database and query practice.  

#### Problems that I have faced

This course's difficulty level is well balanced. Some of the jobs 
were simple, while others were rather difficult. Still, I have faced two major problem listed below:  

1. While cleaning and cropping the data, I was struggling to ensure that my code was generating correct output. To address this problem, I have created backup of the original data. Then, I have checked both original data and copy data after processing to ensure the correct result.
2. Choosing a nosql database and then implementing same database model with mongodb was little bit challenging for me. To solve this issue, I have read the mongodb documentation.


#### Strength:
1. Previous experiences of python and mysql from my Undergraduate.
2. Ability to search programming error from the internet and understand the solution.


#### Weakness:
1. Working with a lot of data
2. NoSQL database

This is my first time working on a huge dataset and also with NoSQL database. However, I feel that NoSQL databases are an essential aspect of the area of data science. This is an area that I need to improve. However, this work has exposed me to NoSQL for future development.
I'm still new at python programming. I feel that I can steadily improve my python programming abilities. It's only a matter of getting additional practice to hone your talents.
Finally, it was a joyful and cheerful coding exercise that helped me get started with data science programming.
